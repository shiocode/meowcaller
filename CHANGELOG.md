# Changelog

All notable changes to meowcaller, tracked per module. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Each entry notes the module's
**validation state**: `scaffolded` (signatures + KAT test, bodies are TODO),
`implemented` (bodies written), or `KAT-verified` (its reference vector passes).

## [Unreleased]

### reference sync — local checkout to `oxidezap/whatsapp-rust-private`@`674e851`
- Converted the local Rust reference into a real git checkout of
  `oxidezap/whatsapp-rust-private` (branch `feat/voip-media-stack`) and reset to the
  tip `674e851` (== our SOT pin; the public-repo permalinks are unchanged — commits
  cherry-pick onto `oxidezap/whatsapp-rust`).
- Verified every datasheet's embedded verbatim against the current tree. Result:
  **all current except `mlow-encoder`**. The supposedly-stale `pitch`/`synth`/
  `noise`/`decoder` and `call`/`relay`/`session` are fully current — their sources
  just span multiple files (and the orchestration ones live in the tokio `src/`
  crate). All built-module datasheets (toc, rangecoder, mem, lpc) are current.
- `mlow-encoder` (#16, unbuilt): ~208 verbatim lines diverged because the encoder
  source was **reorganized** — old combined `analysis.rs` split into `analysis.rs`
  + `smpl_pitch_enc.rs`, and the pitch estimator changed (the known ~0.03
  divergence). Faithful refresh = restructuring to the new file layout, deferred to
  when module #16 is built (local reference is now current, so it ingests correctly
  then).

### reference sync (patch `d441e5fa…current`)
- Applied the upstream `wacore/src/voip/mlow/*.rs` source changes to the local
  reference. Net effect on **built** modules: none functional.
  - `smpl_mem.rs`: loader refactored (runtime tables now zlib+postcard `.bin` via
    new `smpl_tables_blob::load_blob`; the inline JSON parse became a `#[cfg(test)]`
    generator helper). The `SmplMem` memory model and **all accessors are
    byte-identical** → `mlow/mem` Go and tests unchanged. The heap-window data is
    verified identical (same regions + `g_cc/g_nrg/g_pitch/clk`), so our embedded
    `smpl_cc_blob.json` stays valid. Datasheet `mlow-mem.md` updated to the current
    source and the packaging change; SOT permalinks stay pinned to the ported
    commit `674e851…`.
  - `toc.rs`, `rangecoder.rs`, `smpl_lpc.rs`, `silk_lsf_cos_tab.rs`, `smpl_perc.rs`
    are **not** in the patch → `toc`, `rangecoder`, `mem` cosine table, and the
    `lpc` scaffold/FFT-dependency are unaffected.
- Not applied: the binary `.bin` blobs (patch lacks full index lines) and the
  `smpl_cc_blob.json` / `smpl_tables.json` deletions — we keep the JSON as our data
  source (the `.bin` are an upstream re-encoding of identical data).
- Flag: the patch also changed the reference for not-yet-built modules
  (`smpl_decode`, `smpl_lsf_quant`, `smpl_synth`, `smpl_pitch_enc`, `analysis`,
  `encode`). Their pre-written datasheets now carry stale verbatim source; they will
  be re-ingested from the (now-current) local reference when each module is built.

### mlow/lpc
- scaffolded: constants + the five public envelope functions (smplWindowLPC20,
  smplLPCAnalyzeWithF2, smplLPCInterpol/Idx, smplA2NLSF16) with three-line stubs.
  Tests wired to lsf_quant_io.json (forward A→NLSF, bit-exact) and fe_dump.json
  (windowing exact + FFT-autocorr tolerance); both fail until implemented. The
  cross-module qlsf round-trip test is skipped pending #06/#10.
  Open: (a) smplLPCAnalyzeWithF2 needs a 512-pt real FFT (no module/datasheet yet);
  (b) the registry's lsf_vectors.json pins the LSF wire (#05/#06), not this
  front-end — lpc validates against lsf_quant_io.json + fe_dump.json.

### mlow/mem
- implemented: SmplMem accessors (LE U8/U16/U32, signed I16/I32, out-of-region
  zero fallback, CDFAt 2-byte stride). Heap ROM loaded via go:embed from
  mlow/smpl_cc_blob.json (moved out of testdata per review) behind a sync.Once
  singleton. Load/pointer + accessor-semantics + cosine-transcription tests pass;
  byte-exact CDF KAT skipped — mem has no direct vector in the reference, so
  smpl_tables.json is verified transitively by the decode modules.
- scaffolded: SmplMem type + accessor signatures; cosine table
  (silkLSFCosTabFIXQ12, 129 entries) transcribed verbatim.

### mlow/rangecoder
- KAT-verified: decoder replays the 2000-op and 1500-op CDF scripts to the listed
  values; encoder re-encodes both byte-identically to rc_vectors.json (4/4 tests).
- implemented: full RangeDecoder + RangeEncoder bodies (ec_dec/ec_enc) as a
  uint32-modular port; sticky Err/err fields, no error returns.
- scaffolded: RangeDecoder + RangeEncoder types and all method signatures; four
  KAT tests wired to testdata/rc_vectors.json (decode + re-encode).

### mlow/toc
- KAT-verified: ParseSmplTOC matches toc_vectors.json (256/256 byte values).
- implemented: ParseSmplTOC body + standardOpusFrameMs helper.
- scaffolded: SmplTOC type + ParseSmplTOC signature + exhaustive KAT test wired
  to testdata/toc_vectors.json (256 byte values).

### Planning
- Datasheets for all 28 modules under `datasheets/`: each carries the reference
  source verbatim, the Go envelope (signatures only), and implementation
  suggestions. Verbatim source verified complete (line-count match vs source);
  7 initially-truncated sheets re-pasted in full.
- Project framework: `PLAN.md` (engineering plan), `AGENTS.md` (human-audited
  module-by-module build protocol), `MODULES.md` (module registry + build order),
  per-module datasheets under `datasheets/`.
